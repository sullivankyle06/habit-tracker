# **Habit Tracker Application - Requirements Document**

## **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the **Habit Tracker Application**. The purpose of this application is to help users track and manage their habits over time. It will provide insights into user progress, remind them of their goals, and encourage consistent habit formation.

## **2. System Overview**

The Habit Tracker Application will be a web or mobile-based tool that allows users to:
- Add and track habits
- Set daily/weekly goals for each habit
- Receive reminders and notifications
- View habit progress through charts and statistics
- Analyze patterns over time and suggest improvements

The application will be designed with ease of use in mind, aiming for intuitive navigation and interaction.

## **3. Functional Requirements**

### **3.1 User Management**

- **Sign-up/Sign-in**: Users should be able to create an account and log in using email and password or third-party authentication (Google, Facebook, etc.).
- **Profile Management**: Users can view and update their profile information (name, email, password, etc.).
- **Data Synchronization**: User data should be synchronized across devices.

### **3.2 Habit Tracking**

- **Add Habit**: Users should be able to add new habits to track (e.g., "Drink water", "Exercise", "Read a book").
  - Each habit can have customizable attributes such as:
    - **Habit name**
    - **Category** (e.g., fitness, productivity, wellness)
    - **Frequency** (e.g., daily, weekly)
    - **Start and end date**
    - **Goal (e.g., 10,000 steps per day)**
- **Mark Completion**: Users should be able to mark a habit as completed for a given day.
  - Ability to mark completion in bulk (e.g., for the whole week) or individually for each day.
- **Streak Tracking**: The app should track streaks for each habit (e.g., number of consecutive days completed).

### **3.3 Reminders and Notifications**

- **Reminder Setup**: Users should be able to set up reminders for each habit.
  - Frequency of reminders (daily, weekly, specific days/times).
- **Push Notifications**: The app should send push notifications when it’s time to perform a habit or when a goal is approaching.
- **Email Notifications**: Optional email notifications for daily/weekly progress reports.

### **3.4 Progress and Analytics**

- **Progress Dashboard**: Users should have access to a dashboard displaying:
  - **Completion rates** (percentage of completed tasks)
  - **Streaks** (consecutive days)
  - **Goals** (visualization of goal completion)
  - **Recent activity** (recent habits marked as completed)
- **Charts and Graphs**: The app should generate:
  - **Line charts** for habit completion over time.
  - **Bar charts** for weekly/monthly statistics.
  - **Pie charts** for habit categories (e.g., how much time spent on fitness vs wellness habits).
- **Habit Insights**: Based on user data, provide insights such as:
  - Best days for habit completion.
  - Patterns in habit formation (e.g., high success rates on weekends).

### **3.5 Habit Goals**

- **Set Habit Goals**: Users should be able to set specific goals for each habit (e.g., “Read 20 pages every day”).
- **Track Progress Toward Goals**: Display progress towards each goal, including a percentage completed and milestones.

### **3.6 Habit Categories**

- **Categorization**: Users can categorize habits (e.g., Fitness, Wellness, Productivity, etc.).
- **Custom Categories**: Users can create custom categories for habits.

### **3.7 Data Export**

- **Export Data**: Users should be able to export their habit tracking data (e.g., CSV, PDF) for analysis or sharing.

## **4. Non-Functional Requirements**

### **4.1 Performance**

- **Scalability**: The application should be able to scale to handle many users simultaneously without significant performance degradation.
- **Response Time**: The system should respond within 2 seconds for 95% of user interactions.
  
### **4.2 Usability**

- **User Interface**: The app should have a simple, intuitive user interface, optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Accessibility**: The application must be accessible to users with disabilities, including screen reader support and keyboard navigation.
- **Multi-language Support**: Initially, the app should support at least English and one other major language (e.g., Spanish or French).

### **4.3 Security**

- **Authentication**: The app must implement secure authentication protocols (OAuth, two-factor authentication).
- **Data Protection**: User data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Privacy**: User data must not be shared with third parties without explicit consent.

### **4.4 Backup and Recovery**

- **Data Backup**: User data should be regularly backed up to prevent loss in case of failure.
- **Disaster Recovery**: The application should be able to recover from failures within 30 minutes to minimize data loss.

### **4.5 Reliability**

- **Uptime**: The application should have an uptime of at least 99.9%.
- **Error Handling**: The system should gracefully handle errors and provide helpful error messages to users.

## **5. Technical Requirements**

- **Platform**: The application will be developed for both web and mobile platforms (iOS/Android).
- **Tech Stack**: 
  - Frontend: React (Web), React Native (Mobile)
  - Backend: Node.js, Express
  - Database: MongoDB (or PostgreSQL)
  - Notification Service: Firebase or similar push notification services
- **Hosting**: The app will be hosted on AWS, Azure, or a similar platform.
