- Potential for gamification with a fresh twist compared to Habitica.
- Modern UI/UX can set it apart from clunky or overly clinical interfaces.
- Niche focus: You can address underserved user needs (e.g., mental wellness, daily productivity).

---

#### **Weaknesses **
- Limited brand recognition compared to Apple or Strava.
- Smaller development resources.
- Lack of integration with wearables and health data out of the box.
- Potentially limited user base early on, making community or competition features harder to scale.

---

#### **Opportunities **
- Rising interest in personal development, productivity, and self-optimization.
- Integration with AI for personalized habit suggestions and feedback.
- Potential partnerships with wellness influencers or micro-communities.
- Cross-platform availability, including web or wearable apps.

#### **Threats **
- Intense competition from well-funded, established apps like Apple Health or Strava.
- Changing privacy regulations.
- Users may stick with what’s already working unless you clearly show value.
- App fatigue—people install many apps but don’t use them consistently.


#### **Extra context **
- We will be using Strava running app, Apple Health, and Habitica as our comparison applications
- As the team continues to develop, we really need to focus on what demographics we will want to focus this application for
- As of now, we are focusing fitness-minded individuals who struggle to maintain routine without motivation
- Gamifying good habits will help to motivate individuals to exercise
